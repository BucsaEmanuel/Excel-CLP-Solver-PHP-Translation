# Excel-CLP-Solver-PHP-Translation
Attempt at translating the Excel CLP Solver (original author Güneş Erdoğan)

Original file can be found at: https://people.bath.ac.uk/ge277/index.php/clp-spreadsheet-solver/

I extracted the two VB scripts and started the tedious process of translation to PHP.

Since I don't know any visual basic, I expect this to take a long time.
